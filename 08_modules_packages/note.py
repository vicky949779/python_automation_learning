''' What is the PEPs Website?
----------------------------------------------------------- 
The website https://peps.python.org/ is where you can find official documents that describe how Python should work. These documents are called PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals).

Why Should You Use It?
Learn Python Best Practices

Example: PEP 8 tells you how to write clean and readable Python code.
Understand New Features

Example: PEP 484 introduced type hints (def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:).
See How Python Evolves

Every major change in Python is explained in a PEP before it is added to the language.
Example: Why is PEP 8 Important?
Let’s say you're writing Python code. Without guidelines, different developers might format their code differently. PEP 8 gives rules like: ✅ Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
✅ Keep lines shorter than 79 characters

Do You Need to Read PEPs?
If you're learning Python, you don’t need to read all PEPs.
If you want to follow best practices, PEP 8 and PEP 257 (docstrings) are useful.
If you're interested in Python’s future updates, new PEPs explain them. '''
